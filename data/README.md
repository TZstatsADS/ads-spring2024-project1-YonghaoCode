# Yonghao Xu (yx2838) Project 1: What is the relationship between the entertainment and happy moment?
### Data folder

first of all, I used the Text_Processing.Rmd file to provide a new processed_moments.csv which i am gonna mention in next step. According to my research goal, I choose entertainment-dict.csv as my key word file. And the demographic.csv contains all the people in the survey's personal infomation.These four files is the basic files for the research.

By learning the keywords related to entertainment in the x document, I generated a csv file named filtered_dataset. I used the data in this document for final analysis.ï¼ˆBecause of the mergred file is too big to upload on Github so that i show the filtered_dataset.csv directly.
