### Output folder

In the analysis of entertainment choices between males and females, as well as adults and minors within a sample, we observed distinct patterns in preferences:

Males: The analysis showed that males have a diverse range of interests with the most significant proportion of keywords related to 'video' content. However, 'book' and 'read' also had a substantial presence, indicating a balanced interest in both visual and literary content.

Females: Females in the sample demonstrated a pronounced preference for 'music', which was overwhelmingly the most common keyword. This suggests that music-related activities are a central part of entertainment for females, much more so than for males.

Adults: For adults, 'band' was the most significant keyword, followed closely by 'read' and 'book'. This indicates a strong interest in music and reading. The presence of 'music' and related terms like 'concert' and 'song' further reinforces the inclination towards musical activities.

Minors: Minors showed a strong preference for 'vid' and 'video', indicating a focus on visual and streaming media. 'Netflix' also emerged as a significant keyword, underscoring the popularity of streaming services. The interest in 'book' was present but less pronounced than in adults.

Overall, the statistical data suggest that there are generational and gender-based differences in entertainment preferences. Males and adults have a broader range of interests with less concentration in any single category, showing a preference for a mix of video content and reading. Females and minors, on the other hand, display more focused interests, with females leaning towards music and minors towards digital media such as videos and streaming services.

The patterns observed could be reflective of broader cultural trends and changes in the media landscape, with digital media gaining prominence among younger audiences and traditional forms of entertainment such as music and books maintaining a strong following among adults and across genders. This analysis provides insight into the target demographics for various entertainment industries and could inform marketing and content creation strategies.
